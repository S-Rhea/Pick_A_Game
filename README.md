# Pick_A_Game
Python script to pick a random game from a list when you just can't decide.

My friend and I can never decide what game we want to play together, so I made a little script that will decide for us.

Menu options are not specific so the app can be used for something other than games.


Instructions
=============
Run the App.pyw to begin.
You can add or remove games from the list.
To add a game, click the add button on the main menu and type the name of the game you want to add.
To remove a game, click the remove button and type the number of the game you want to remove.
